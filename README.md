Employee Management MERN Application
This is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application designed to manage employee data. The app allows administrators to manage employee records, including creating, updating, and deleting employee information, uploading profile images, and organizing employees by departments or roles.

Features
Authentication: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure login and protected routes.
Employee Management: CRUD operations for employee data, including name, email, mobile, designation, and more.
File Uploads: Supports profile image uploads to Cloudinary.
Data Validation: Input validation on the client and server using Validator and Mongoose schema validation.
Responsive UI: Frontend built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS.
Routing: Client-side routing with React Router.
Error Handling: Custom middleware for error handling in Express.
